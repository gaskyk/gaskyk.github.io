<p>Hi, I'm Karen, and I am a Principal Data Scientist for the UK government. Previously I worked in the <a href="https://onsbigdata.github.io/">Office for National Statistics Big Data team</a> and the NHS. My interests include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Leading data science teams</li>
  <li>Communicating data science to lay audiences</li>
  <li>The technical aspects of data science</li>
</ul>
<p>I have some information about my work <a href="https://gaskyk.github.io/my_work/">here</a>, and the posts below talk about thoughts or small data science projects I've done outside work for my own interest.</p>
