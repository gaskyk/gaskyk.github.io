<p>Hi, I'm Karen, a data scientist who likes having fun with data! I love using <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> for my work.</p>
<p>I have some information about my work on the <a href="https://gaskyk.github.io/publications/">publications</a> page, and the posts below talk about small data science projects I've done outside work for my own interest.</p>
