<p>Hi, I'm Karen, and I like having fun with data! I am currently a Principal Data Scientist for the UK government, and previously I worked in the <a href="https://onsbigdata.github.io/">Office for National Statistics Big Data team</a>.</p>
<p>I have some information about my work on the <a href="https://gaskyk.github.io/my_work/">My work</a> page, and the posts below talk about thoughts or small data science projects I've done outside work for my own interest.</p>
