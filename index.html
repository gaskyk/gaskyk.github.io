<p>Hi, I'm Karen, a data scientist who likes having fun with data! I love using <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> for my work.</p>
<p>The majority of my work is not on GitHub but I do have a few projects <a href="https://github.com/gaskyk">here</a>.</p>
