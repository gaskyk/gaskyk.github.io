Breastfeeding is recommended as the best way to feed your baby for at least the first six months of its life, with a variety of benefits for both mum and baby. At the same time, breastfeeding rates in the UK are [amongst the lowest in the world](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35438049). However, breastfeeding is \*hard\*. I recorded every minute I spent breastfeeding and track my story with data below.

## I spent 482 hours breastfeeding over the first 7 months of my baby&#39;s life

**I spent more time breastfeeding in the first few months**

That&#39;s equivalent to 20 days solid, and an average of 2.5 hours per day! As the graph shows below, there were large differences in how much time I spent breastfeeding each day for the first month, before gradually reducing that daily time between months 2 and 5. By month 6 my baby was fighting all but the first feed of the day (so I stopped all others), and stopped altogether when I got ill after 7 months of breastfeeding.

**There&#39;s a lot of fluctuation in how much time I spent breastfeeding during the first month**

What chaos! A few things jump out at me from this; having a baby is a complete physical and mental shock. I was totally unprepared for breastfeeding and had no idea how long I was supposed to breastfeed for. As a result there&#39;s a lot of fluctuation in duration in the first couple of weeks.

On day 23 I called the [NCT breastfeeding helpline](https://www.nct.org.uk/baby-toddler/feeding/early-days/breastfeeding-support-nct) asking for support to increase my baby&#39;s breastfeeding, and decrease her dependency on formula which we were asked to give her from day 5. The jump on day 24 is evident and on day 25 I spent the most time breastfeeding - a whopping 7 hours, 38 minutes!

## Charting all my feeds

**After two months a pattern in feeding times emerges**

This is an insightful graph! I can see:

- How chaotic the first 50 days were with no routine and feeding at all times of day and night! After this, a pattern for feeding times forms
- At day 89 there seems to be a step change and my baby wakes for a feed after 6am for the first time â€“ result!
- Around day 150 feeds get shorter and I continue breastfeeding for only the first feed of the day.

## Summary

It has been fascinating to look back on my breastfeeding journey with the benefit of hindsight and to see some of the high- and lowlights I remember, but without the emotion I attached to it at the time! To do this analysis I downloaded my data from the [Baby Tracker app](https://nighp.com/babytracker/), and produced the [code here](https://github.com/gaskyk/baby_tracker) to analyse it.
