## Overview

I have found some [open data](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/6449d8f5-76e7-4aff-bfb1-46d46542a56c/footfall) showing hourly footfall from several cameras in York city centre every hour from 2009 until late in 2018. This seems fun so I downloaded it and hope to find the time to analyse it (including temporal patters) fully soon.

In the meantime, I have generated a map showing the four camera locations and footfall every hour during an average Saturday in 2018:
