## Media interviews

I have been interviewed regularly on national and local radio explaining my work, including on [BBC Radio 5 Live](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jTxdoqJD7gbnMiRn7f57WxHbuUTBVBNh/view?usp=sharing) and BBC Radio 2. I was also interviewed on the [BBC news channel](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-25836232) about young adults living with their parents.

I have discussed my work to journalists from national newspapers, for example outlining the factors which lead to couples splitting up with [Men's Health magazine](https://gaskyk.github.io/assets/Should_you_marry_her.pdf).


## Technical projects

I have worked on a wide variety of data science projects in my time, but more recent ones include:
- Prompt engineering using the OpenAI API to score the relevance of open source academic papers to our work, significantly reducing the volume of papers to be read by human analysts
- Using Natural Language Processing and clustering on Amazon Web Service's SageMaker (in Python) to group 2 million academic papers into digestible groups, allowing analysts to focus their work on those areas of academic research which are growing rapidly
- Using Natural Language Processing and clustering to link different reports about defects, enabling engineers to better prioritise fixing the most important defects
- Using PySpark on Cloudera's distributed computing platform to analyse non-standard international migration patterns. For the first time this enabled our organisation to understand the range and type of migration patterns people undergo
- Using machine learning in Python to parse then match addresses. A [report](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologicalpublications/generalmethodology/onsworkingpaperseries/onsworkingpaperseriesno17usingdatasciencefortheaddressmatchingservice) and [code](https://github.com/ONSdigital/address-index-data) are available
- Using Natural Language Processing and machine learning to understand areas containing caravan homes from descriptions of properties on the [Zoopla website](https://www.zoopla.co.uk/). This could save up to Â£6.6 million by prioritising census field officers to those areas which are more difficult to count. A [report](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologicalpublications/generalmethodology/onsworkingpaperseries/onsmethodologyworkingpaperseriesno11identifyingcaravanhomesinzoopladatajune2017), [blog post](https://digitalblog.ons.gov.uk/2017/06/21/happy-campers-using-machine-learning-to-identify-caravans-in-zoopla-data/) and [code](https://github.com/ONSBigData/housing-websites) are available
